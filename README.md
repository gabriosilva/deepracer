# AWS DeepRacer Reward Function Implementation
## Overview
This project is all about fine-tuning the reward function to train an autonomous vehicle effectively on AWS DeepRacer tracks. Our goal is to keep the car on the track, encourage speed, and ensure it follows the racing line as closely as possible.

## Features
- Dynamic Speed Rewards: Adjusts rewards based on the car's speed and steering angle, promoting faster speeds with minimal steering.
- Off-Track Penalties: Implements penalties for going off-track or not aligning well with the track direction, ensuring the car stays on the correct path.
- Efficiency Optimization: Rewards the car for making progress through the track efficiently, using a combination of progress and steps taken.
## How It Works
1. Initialization: Sets up a basic reward and extracts essential parameters like the car's position, speed, and orientation relative to the track's center.
2. Speed and Steering Analysis: Rewards or penalizes the car based on its speed and the sharpness of its turns.
3. Track Alignment: Checks the car's alignment with the track direction, applying penalties for significant deviations.
4. Progress Evaluation: Increases rewards based on the car's progress around the track, encouraging efficient completion.
